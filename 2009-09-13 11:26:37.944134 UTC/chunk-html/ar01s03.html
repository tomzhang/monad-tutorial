    In this section, I will cover off on some of the common misunderstandings around monads. Particularly those
    misunderstandings that may hinder progress in understanding the concept.
  </p><div class="sect2" title="Side-Effects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2783364"></a>Side-Effects</h3></div></div></div><p>
      It is a common misunderstanding that monads are all about side-effects, particularly in a pure functional
      programming language. It is true that monads can provide a mechanism for controlling side-effects, but this is
      only one instance of the use of monads.
    </p><p>
      To draw an analogy, suppose you wrote a function to compute the length of a linked list. If you wrote this
      function responsibly, it would work on a list of any element type. In other words, the function would be
      <span class="emphasis"><em>polymorphic</em></span>. You might use this function to compute the length of a list of
      <code class="code">Banana</code> elements, but this would not be sufficient to say that your length function is in some way
      related to the <code class="code">Banana</code> type.
    </p><p>
      Just like you can compute the length of a list of <code class="code">Banana</code> elements, it is also true that you can use
      monads to represent side-effects, but the relationship does not go any further. In other words, the relationship
      between monads and side-effects is incredibly weak at a stretch, but non-existent in practical terms. Later on,
      once we know what monad means, we will see a demonstration of how side-effects can be represented using monads. 
    </p><p>
      To fully appreciate this point, consider that monads are not specific to any particular programming language. For
      example, monads are relevant in a language that could not possibly be described as a
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pure functional programming language</span>&#8221;</span>, such as Java. The next section will discuss this.
