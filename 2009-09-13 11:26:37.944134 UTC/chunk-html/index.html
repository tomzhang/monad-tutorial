    The monad concept is surrounded by mysticism among many programmers. It is poorly understood and its importance is
    widely under-appreciated. In this essay, I will attempt to provide a concrete understanding of the term and I will
    also explicitly address many of the common myths. I will also provide insight into the importance of the concept
    and why it should matter to you.
  </p><p>
    A few different programming languages will be used; Java, C#, Haskell and Scala to name a few. This is because
    monads are unrelated to specific programming languages. Indeed, monads are relavent to any typical programming
    language. However, you are not expected to be intimate with the syntaxes of these various languages. Where there is
    possibility for the syntax to cause confusion, clarification will be provided.
  </p><p>
    This essay will not use cute metaphors as in other monad tutorials. Monads are not space-suits or any such notion
    that may confuse a reader. We will not go into the heavy mathematics behind monads (category theory), however, you
    will be expected to think somewhat abstractly at times, but only to an extent that you are probably familiar with.
  </p><p>
    I intend to be thorough in debunking many of the misunderstandings and providing all the tools to help you
    understand this apparently elusive computer programming concept and its important application. It must be said that
    that monads are a simpler concept than their reputation would have you believe and you will soon see why. I hope you
    enjoy this essay and it brings you enlightenment and adds to your tools to make you a more effective computer
    programmer. If you have questions, feedback or criticism, please send it to the mailing list
