    The monad concept is surrounded by mysticism among many programmers. It is poorly understood and its importance is
    widely under-appreciated. In this essay, I will attempt to provide a concrete understanding of the term and I will
    also explicitly address many of the common myths. I will also provide insight into the importance of the concept
    and why it should matter to you.
  </p><p>
    A few different programming languages will be used; Java, C#, Haskell and Scala to name a few. This is because
    monads are unrelated to specific programming languages. Indeed, monads are relavent to any typical programming
    language. However, you are not expected to be intimate with the syntaxes of these various languages. Where there is
    possibility for the syntax to cause confusion, clarification will be provided.
  </p><p>
    This essay will not use cute metaphors as in other monad tutorials. Monads are not space-suits or any such notion
    that may confuse a reader. We will not go into the heavy mathematics behind monads (category theory), however, you
    will be expected to think somewhat abstractly at times, but only to an extent that you are probably familiar with.
  </p><p>
    I intend to be thorough in debunking many of the misunderstandings and providing all the tools to help you
    understand this apparently elusive computer programming concept and its important application. It must be said that
    that monads are a simpler concept than their reputation would have you believe and you will soon see why. I hope you
    enjoy this essay and it brings you enlightenment and adds to your tools to make you a more effective computer
    programmer. If you have questions, feedback or criticism, please send it to the mailing list
    <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:monad-tutorial@googlegroups.com">monad-tutorial@googlegroups.com</a>&gt;</code>.

      This tutorial will use various programming languages, though you needn't be intimately familiar with their
      differences. It is worth noting however, the differences in function signature syntax. Examples are below.

      <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a monad?</em></span> seems to be the question that is most often put forward by curious
      observers. However, within this question is the implicit assumption of the existence of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>a monad</em></span> as if it were a thing that has some kind of observable manifestation. Let's not get
      mystical here; an explanation is in order.
    </p><p>
      Consider the example of an interface called <code lang="Java" class="code">CharSequence</code> in the standard Java library.
      Here is a shortened version of that interface:
      </p><div class="example"><a name="id2580358"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 5. <code lang="Java" class="code">java.lang.CharSequence</code> (abbreviated)</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
          interface CharSequence {
            char charAt(int index);
            int length();
          }
        </pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">
      Now suppose someone put forward the question, <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a CharSequence?</em></span> Notice the potential
      here for equivocation. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Well it's an interface!</span>&#8221;</span> might be an appropriate response. A follow-up
      question might be <span class="emphasis"><em>Is a String a CharSequence?</em></span> Of course, the answer is
      yes, so a <code lang="Java" class="code">String</code> is a <code class="code">CharSequence</code> and
      <code lang="Java" class="code">CharSequence</code> is an interface, therefore, a <code lang="Java" class="code">String</code> is an
      interface. I hope you see the problem here. Attempting to explain this problem might confuse further and give the
      appearance of appealing to vague and vacuous notions.
    </p><p>
      The question <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a monad?</em></span> is only as meaningful as the question
      <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a CharSequence?</em></span> Indeed, if Java's type system were flexible enough, one would begin
      by writing: <code lang="Java" class="code">interface Monad</code> and we would write suitable implementations of this
      interface and this would provide the answer to <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a Monad?</em></span>. But let's not get carried
      away just yet.
    </p><p>
      In this essay, we will avoid referring to <span class="emphasis"><em>a monad</em></span> to avoid this potential for confusion.
      This may seem like a minor point, but there are many implications and pitfalls if this terminology were to be
      maintained. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">A monad</span>&#8221;</span> so to speak, <span class="emphasis"><em>is an interface</em></span>. It's just an interface and
      nothing more, which is why it may appear intangible (but it's just an interface!), with a few notable remarks:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            The Monad interface cannot be expressed using some static type systems because they are too inflexible. Both
            Java and C#<sup>[<a name="id2579773" href="#ftn.id2579773" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> are examples where this is not possible while it is possible using both Haskell and Scala.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The Monad interface is both fundamental and extremely useful in every-day programming, much more so than the
            typical interfaces that you might find.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The instances of <code lang="Java" class="code">CharSequence</code> usually look rather similar and have a general common
            theme. This can be said about many interfaces. However, the instances for a hypothetical <code class="code">Monad</code>
            interface can look vastly different, even though they all implement the same interface.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
      It is the far-reaching implications and incredible usefulness of the monad interface that takes some effort to
      fully appreciate. So let's do that.
    </p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="¬Monad"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="NotMonad"></a>¬Monad</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Side-Effects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2580603"></a>Side-Effects</h3></div></div></div><p>
      It is a common misunderstanding that monads are all about side-effects, particularly in a pure functional
      programming language. It is true that monads can provide a mechanism for controlling side-effects, but this is
      only one instance of the use of monads.
    </p><p>
      To draw an analogy, suppose you wrote a function to compute the length of a linked list. If you wrote this
      function responsibly, it would work on a list of any element type. In other words, the function would be
      <span class="emphasis"><em>polymorphic</em></span>. You might use this function to compute the length of a list of
      <code class="code">Banana</code> elements, but this would not be sufficient to say that your length function is in some way
      related to the <code class="code">Banana</code> type.
    </p><p>
      Just like you can compute the length of a list of <code class="code">Banana</code> elements, it is also true that you can use
      monads to represent side-effects, but the relationship does not go any further. In other words, the relationship
      between monads and side-effects is incredibly weak at a stretch, but non-existent in practical terms. Later on,
      once we know what monad means, we will see a demonstration of how side-effects can be represented using monads. 
    </p><p>
      To fully appreciate this point, consider that monads are not specific to any particular programming language. For
      example, monads are relevant in a language that could not possibly be described as a
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">pure functional programming language</span>&#8221;</span>, such as Java. The next section will discuss this.

The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</p></li></ol></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</p><p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.

There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</p></li></ol></div></li></ol></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.id2579773" href="#id2579773" class="para">1</a>] </sup>
