    <para>
      There are many different types of functors; exponential functors, binary functors, contravariant functors,
      convariant functors to name a few. When the term functor is used unqualified, it is safe to assume that the use of
      the term refers to covariant functors. This entire essay concerns itself only with covariant functors (and
      therefore, just <quote>functors</quote>).
