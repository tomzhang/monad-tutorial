    <title>Syntax</title>
    <para>
      This tutorial will use various programming languages, though you needn't be intimately familiar with their
      differences. It is worth noting however, the differences in function signature syntax. Examples are below.
    </para>
    <example>
      <title>A Java function signature</title>
      <programlisting lang="Java">
        &lt;A> int function(String s, A a) {
          ...
        }
      </programlisting>
    </example>
    <example>
      <title>A C# function signature</title>
      <programlisting lang="C#">
        Int Function&lt;A>(String s, A a) {
          ...
        }
      </programlisting>
    </example>
    <example>
      <title>A Scala function signature</title>
      <programlisting lang="Scala">
        def function[A](s: String, a: A): Int =
          ...
      </programlisting>
    </example>
    <example>
      <title>A Haskell function signature</title>
      <programlisting lang="Haskell">
        function :: String -> a -> Int
        function = ...
      </programlisting>
    </example>

      <emphasis>What is a monad?</emphasis> seems to be the question that is most often put forward by curious
      observers. However, within this question is the implicit assumption of the existence of
      <emphasis>a monad</emphasis>. Let's not get mystical here.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the core Java library is an interface called <code lang="Java">CharSequence</code>. Here is a shortened version
      of that interface:
      <example>
        <title><code lang="Java">java.lang.CharSequence</code> (abbreviated)</title>
        <programlisting>
          interface CharSequence {
            char charAt(int index);
            int length();
          }
        </programlisting>
      </example>
      Now suppose someone put forward the question, <emphasis>What is a CharSequence?</emphasis> Notice the potential
      here for equivocation. <quote>Well it's an interface!</quote> might be an appropriate response. A follow-up
      question might be <emphasis>Is <code lang="Java">String</code> a CharSequence?</emphasis> Of course, the answer is
      yes, so <code lang="Java">String</code> is a <code>CharSequence</code> and
      <code lang="Java">CharSequence</code> is an interface, therefore, <code lang="Java">String</code> is an interface.
      I hope you see the problem here.
    </para>
    <para>
      The question <emphasis>What is a monad?</emphasis> is only as meaningful as the question
      <emphasis>What is a CharSequence?</emphasis> Indeed, if Java's type system were flexible enough, one would begin
      by writing: <code lang="Java">interface Monad</code> and we would write suitable implementatiions of this
      interface. But let's not get carried away just yet.
    </para>
    <para>
      In this document, we will avoid referring to <emphasis>a monad</emphasis> to avoid this potential for confusion.
