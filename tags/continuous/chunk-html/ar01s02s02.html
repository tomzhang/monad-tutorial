      <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a monad?</em></span> seems to be the question that is most often put forward by curious
      observers. However, within this question is the implicit assumption of the existence of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>a monad</em></span> as if it were a thing that has some kind of observable manifestation. Let's not get
      mystical here; an explanation is in order.
    </p><p>
      Consider the example of an interface called <code lang="Java" class="code">CharSequence</code> in the standard Java library.
      Here is a shortened version of that interface:
      </p><div class="example"><a name="id2776176"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 5. <code lang="Java" class="code">java.lang.CharSequence</code> (abbreviated)</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
          interface CharSequence {
            char charAt(int index);
            int length();
          }
        </pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">
      Now suppose someone put forward the question, <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a CharSequence?</em></span> Notice the potential
      here for equivocation. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Well it's an interface!</span>&#8221;</span> might be an appropriate response. A follow-up
      question might be <span class="emphasis"><em>Is a String a CharSequence?</em></span> Of course, the answer is
      yes, so a <code lang="Java" class="code">String</code> is a <code class="code">CharSequence</code> and
      <code lang="Java" class="code">CharSequence</code> is an interface, therefore, a <code lang="Java" class="code">String</code> is an
      interface. I hope you see the problem here. Attempting to explain this problem might confuse further and give the
      appearance of appealing to vague and vacuous notions.
    </p><p>
      The question <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a monad?</em></span> is only as meaningful as the question
      <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a CharSequence?</em></span> Indeed, if Java's type system were flexible enough, one would begin
      by writing: <code lang="Java" class="code">interface Monad</code> and we would write suitable implementations of this
      interface and this would provide the answer to <span class="emphasis"><em>What is a Monad?</em></span>. But let's not get carried
      away just yet.
    </p><p>
      In this essay, we will avoid referring to <span class="emphasis"><em>a monad</em></span> to avoid this potential for confusion.
      This may seem like a minor point, but there are many implications and pitfalls if this terminology were to be
      maintained. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">A monad</span>&#8221;</span> so to speak, <span class="emphasis"><em>is an interface</em></span>. It's just an interface and
      nothing more, which is why it may appear intangible (but it's just an interface!), with a few notable remarks:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
            The Monad interface cannot be expressed using some static type systems because they are too inflexible. Both
            Java and C#<sup>[<a name="id2775523" href="#ftn.id2775523" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> are examples where this is not possible while it is possible using both Haskell and Scala.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The Monad interface is both fundamental and extremely useful in every-day programming, much more so than the
            typical interfaces that you might find.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The instances of <code lang="Java" class="code">CharSequence</code> usually look rather similar and have a general common
            theme. This can be said about many interfaces. However, the instances for a hypothetical <code class="code">Monad</code>
            interface can look vastly different, even though they all implement the same interface.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
      It is the far-reaching implications and incredible usefulness of the monad interface that takes some effort to
      fully appreciate. So let's do that.
